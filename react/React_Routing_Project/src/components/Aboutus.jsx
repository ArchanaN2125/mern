        <h3>Welcome to the About side of this content</h3>
        <p>
            There have been several Tom and Jerry DVDs released in Region 1 (United States and Canada), such as the Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases DVDs. In October 2004, Warner Home Video released the first volume of Tom and Jerry
            Spotlight Collection; a two-disc set with an assortment of Tom and Jerry cartoons presented in random order. Much like the U.K Classic Collection, most of the cartoons were unrestored and sourced from the '80s Turner prints,
            however the CinemaScope cartoons were restored in their correct 2.35:1 aspect ratios and released in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen. The Spotlight Collection also contained numerous special features. In October 2005, Volume 2 
            of the Spotlight Collection was released - which much like the first volume had a random assortment of cartoons, sourced from unrestored Turner Prints (except the CinemaScope cartoons), and contained numerous extras 
            - including an introduction by Whoopi Goldberg about the politically incorrect content in some cartoons. Despite this however, some of the cartoons on Volumes 1 & 2 were censored: having cuts and redubbed Mammy Two Shoes dialogue.
            Warner Home Video eventually offered a disc replacement program offering fixing these errors, and modern pressings of Volumes 1 & 2 present the cartoons uncut. A third and final volume of the Spotlight Collection was
            released in September 2007 - bringing a total of 112 of the 114 original Hanna and Barbera-era Tom and Jerry shorts having been released. Volume 3 received a negative response from fans due to His Mouse Friday being edited 
            (with an extreme zoom-in towards the end to avoid showing a pygmy cannibal), the CinemaScope cartoon Pup on a Picnic being cropped to 16:9, and the cartoons Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat being excluded from these sets due to brief blackface gags.</p>
